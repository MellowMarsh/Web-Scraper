# Robot Web-Scraper
## A Web Scraper is a program that scrapes or gathers data off of websites.

The data that is collected form the robot scraper is given by the parametes that are built into the program.

The purpose of this project is for me to identify useful information for future use on a project that I am currently working on.

In this program I will be using mothertreewellness as my url that my web scraper collects data from. This is my personal wellness site I am using to text my web-scraper.
1. I will need to research and identify where the information is on the page or pages I want to scrape.
2. I will need to define tags, classes, and other features that I want to be scraped.   
3. The scraper will be built in Python.

  - Download Python 3.8.2
  - I am using Atom as my text editor to the program. 
  - I also used IDLE Shell.
  - Python Libraries: Beautifulsoup, and Requests  
    --helpful commands: pip3 install beautifulsoup4, pip3 install requests
  - Start with raw html data
  - Robot scraper collects the data from html (python)
  - Store the data (JSON)
  - Parse the data (python)
  
  Collecting of the Data and Parsing the data are handle by python scripts.
