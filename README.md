# Robot Web-Scraper
## A Web Scraper is a program that scrapes or gathers data off of websites.

The data that is collected form the robot scraper is given by the parametes that are built into the program.

The purpose of this project is for me to identify useful information for future use on a project that I am currently working on.

In this program I will be using facebook.com as my url that my web scraper collects data from.
1. I will need to research and identify where the information is on the page or pages I want to scrape.
2. I will need to define tags, classes, and other features that I want to be scraped.   
3. The scraper will be built in Python.

  - Download Python 
  - I am using Atom as my text editor. 
  - I will also be using The command line to build a virtual enviromant for this program.
  - Python Libraries: Beautiful Soup, and Requests
  - Start with raw html data
  - Robot scraper collects the data from html (python)
  - Store the data (JSON)
  - Parse the data (python)
  
  Collecting of the Data and Parsing the data are handle by python scripts.
